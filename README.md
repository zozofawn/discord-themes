# ZozoFawn's Custom Discord Themes
### Introduction:
Here is a collection of themes I wrote to improve your Discord experience by removing intrusive customization elements. These themes are designed to give you a cleaner, more vanilla look while not breaking the functionality of Discord.
### Available Themes:
**CustomBeGone** - A theme that aims to remove intrusive customization elements from users' profiles, providing a more vanilla Discord experience. You can choose to disable:
- Avatar & Profile Decorations
- Custom Font Styles
- Username Text Effects & Colors
- Custom Nitro Banners
- Nameplates

These options can be added manually with all of the different snippets provided in /CustomBeGone. You can add the patches you want, or use CustomBeGone.css for all of them at once.

**OlderPatches** - A collection of smaller individual patches that help to bring back older Discord features or remove certain unnecessary new ones. Available patches include:
- Old Nitro Badge
- No Gradient Role Colors
- No Guild Tags
- No Quest Badge

### Credits:
I have personally developed all of these CSS snippets myself. All assets referenced within the themes belong to Discord and are not modified in any way.
